# What is a DataMapper? #

This is the design pattern of moving data between objects and a database in order to keep them independent of each other and the mapper itself.  Martin Fowler describes the pattern [here](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dataMapper.html).

ActiveRecord is another design pattern that is often considered in comparison to DataMapper.
